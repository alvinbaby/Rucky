The rickroll is being played in the background invisible to the average user by a program called "WScript.exe" short for Windows Script. You can kill the process via command prompt with the taskkill command as follows excluding quotation marks: "taskkill /F /IM wscript.exe /T" for educational purposes the /F flag means forcefully kill the process. /IM means select the target process to kill by name rather than by process ID. wscript.exe is the name of the process to kill. /T at the end means kill all child processes of the specified process. This should stop the audio from playing immediately.
